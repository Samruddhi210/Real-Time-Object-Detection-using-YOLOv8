Title: Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

Project Overview:

This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8) and OpenCV.
The system captures live video from a webcam and performs fast, accurate object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model.
It demonstrates how Deep Learning + Computer Vision can be applied to build intelligent real-time vision systems.

Technologies Used:

Python, 
OpenCV, 
Ultralytics YOLOv8, 
PyTorch, 
NumPy.

Features:
